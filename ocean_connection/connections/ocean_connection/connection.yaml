description: The ocean_connection is an exciting integration of essential functionalities
  from the Ocean Protocol tech stack into Fetch.ai agents. With this integration,
  you gain the ability to publish data assets and algorithms, consume data, and execute
  algorithms using the Compute-to-Data (C2D) feature. Please note that this integration
  is currently in its alpha version. If you encounter any issues or have questions,
  we encourage you to connect with us on the Discord tech-issues channel (https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/1070364079451033631).
  For those interested, the source code is open-source and available on our GitHub
  repository (https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch). We highly value your input
  and eagerly look forward to your contributions!
