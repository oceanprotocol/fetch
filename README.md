# Ocean Connection
Big data has led to significant privacy concerns, but we have developed a groundbreaking solution to combat this issue while still harnessing business intelligence.
This repository explores the integration of Ocean Protocol’s decentralized data ecosystem with Fetch.ai's Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs),
revolutionizing data exchange with enhanced privacy and security.

## Project Description
We present a groundbreaking integration of Ocean Protocol’s decentralized data ecosystem with Fetch.ai's Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs).
This revolutionary pairing enhances data exchange, preserving user privacy, and unlocking valuable business intelligence.
This integration empowers users to publish, discover, and securely consume data using web3 technology, benefiting from data NFTs for IP rights management and data wallets.
The Ocean Marketplace, akin to Uniswap in finance, facilitates buying, selling, and computation on datasets while ensuring data privacy and secrecy.
Fetch.ai's AEAs, with unique attributes like autonomous resource finding and private key-based transactions, seamlessly execute on-chain tasks.
By connecting AEAs with Ocean's Compute to Data workflows, context-aware recommendations are generated without compromising user privacy.
Additionally, IoT devices can automatically sell data on the marketplace, fostering autonomous adaptive machine learning.
The repository includes essential libraries for AEA to Ocean integration, ensuring data sovereignty and user privacy.
The future vision combines context-aware smart services with data ownership and rewards, ushering in a new era of privacy-first data markets.

Your data, your profits! ✨

To install the Ocean Connection see [this file](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch/blob/main/READMEs/install.md).
Here you'll be guided through the installation step by step and learn about potential issues you could encounter while doing so.

After you have completed the initial installation you can continue [here for a remote set up](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch/blob/main/READMEs/setup-remotely.md)
or [here for a local set up](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch/blob/main/READMEs/setup-locally.md). 

Be aware that for becoming a contributor every function must be tested. A tutorial on how to this you can find
[here](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch/blob/main/READMEs/testing.md).
